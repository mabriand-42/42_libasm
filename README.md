***Your very first own library***

> The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.
> An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or  
other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the  
language and the architectureâ€™s machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures
but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

## Description ##

The objective of this project is to create a static library (.a file).  
It is actually just an archive of the original .o files, made with the `ar` command (a precedessor
of `tar` now just used to make libraries).

<!-- ## Visuals ## -->

## Installation ##

`$ git clone https://github.com/mariebriand/42-CC_Libasm.git` </br>
`$ cd 42-CC_Libasm` </br>
`$ make` / `$ make bonus` </br> for the mandatory / bonus part.

You will then end up with a static library for both.

## Usage ##

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra [main/main_bonus].c libasm.a -no-pie` </br>
`$ ./a.out`
